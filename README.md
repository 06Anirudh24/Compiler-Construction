# Compiler-Construction
## Objective: -
To implement a lexer, parser, and intermediate code generator from scratch (without using Lex/Yacc) using C++. 
## Lexer: -
A DFA-based lexical analyser that recognizes basic lexemes has been implemented. 
## Parser: -
A parse tree is constructed and it prints the level-wise output of the non-terminal from left to right. In case of errors in the input (code), the parser reports the errors and continues parsing.
## Intermediate Code Generator: -
The intermediate code generator outputs the intermediate code in the form of quadruples for program construct expressions and conditional statements.
